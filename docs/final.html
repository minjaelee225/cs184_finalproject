    <h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
    <p> We were initially planning on creating a phase-change simulator but realized that the scope of the project was quite
        enormous. We spent some time together trying to make sense of the paper we were trying to base our simulation on, but
        the paper had a lot of complicated math and physics we could not make sense of. After some consideration, we decided
        to change our final project entirely and opted for a more reasonable project. As a result, we created a third-person
        shooter game in Unity where the player shoots a conic beam from a laser at incoming enemies.

    <h2 align="middle">Technical Approach</h2>
    <!-- What to include in this section:
        - A 1-2 page summary of your technical approach, techniques used, algorithms implemented, etc. (use references to papers
          or other resources for further detail). Highlight how your approach varied from the references used (did you implement
          a subset, or did you change or enhance anything), the unique decisions you made and why.
        - A description of problems encountered and how you tackled them.
        - A description of lessons learned. -->

    <h3 align="middle">Model Degradation</h3>
    <p> One of the features we were planning on implementating for our game was a model degradation component, where the enemy loses
        a certain amount of geometry proportional to how much damage is taken. The idea behind this feature is to taken advantage of
        the halfedge structure introduced in Project 2. After exporting the enemy model from Maya as a .obj file, we used OpenMesh's
        halfedge data structure to read in the triangulated model that we can then modify. We accumulate all of the model's faces in
        an array and shuffle the array to randomize which faces would be deleted. This algorithm also supports the ability to determine
        exactly how many faces we want to delete. Thus, we can show the model degrading over a period of time.
    </p>
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/model_deg.gif" align="middle" width="480px"/>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p> While we can pre-compute these degraded models at various stages, we found it difficult to implement in real time in Unity
        and unfortunately could not integrate this feature into our game.

    <h2 align="middle">Results</h2>
    <p> Your final images, animations, video of your system (whichever is relevant). You can include results that you think show off
        what you built but that you did not have time to go over on presentation day.
